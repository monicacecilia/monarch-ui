        <h4>Exomiser</h4>
        <p>
                <a href="http://monarch-exomiser-web-dev.monarchinitiative.org/exomiser">Exomiser</a>
                is a Java program that functionally annotates variants
                from whole-exome sequencing data starting from a VCF file (version 4).
                The functional annotation code is based on Jannovar and uses UCSC
                KnownGene transcript definitions and hg19 genomic coordinates.<br>
                Variants are prioritized according to user-defined criteria on variant
                frequency, pathogenicity, quality, inheritance pattern, and model
                organism phenotype data. Predicted pathogenicity data was extracted
                from the dbNSFP resource. Cross-species phenotype comparisons are
                powered by the <a href="http://owlsim.org">OWLSim algorithm</a>.<br>
                Exomiser is currently using mouse phenotypes and will soon be leveraging
                the zebrafish phenotype data. Worm and fly phenotype data will be
                available later this year.<br>
                Exomiser is available from the Sanger Institute. A paper describing Exomiser
                is available <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/24/2/340.long">here</a>.

        <h4>PhenIX</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="http://compbio.charite.de/PhenIX/">Phenotypic Interpretation of eXomes</a>,
          is a pipeline for prioritizing candidate genes in exomes or NGS panels with
          comprehensive coverage of human Mendelian disease genes. It ranks genes
          based on predicted variant pathogenicity as well as phenotypic similarity
          of diseases associated with the genes harboring these variants to the
          phenotypic profile of the individual being investigated. PhenIX requires
          a VCF file mapped to hg19/Gchr37, as well as a list of HPO terms representing
          the phenotype observed in the patient. PhenIX is available <a href="http://compbio.charite.de/PhenIX/">here</a>
          from Peter Robinson's group at Charité.

            <h4>ExomeWalker</h4>
            <p>
              <a href="http://compbio.charite.de/ExomeWalker/">ExomeWalker</a>
              is a computational method to prioritize a set of candidates
              in exome sequencing projects that aim to identify novel Mendelian
              disease genes. This approach involves filtering a Variant Call Format
              (VCF) file according to a number of user-definable criteria.<br>
              Genes are prioritized according to a variant score (predicted pathogenicity,
              rarity, pattern of variants compatible with the assumed mode of
              inheritance) and to their vicinity to other genes that belong to the
              same phenotypic disease family within a protein protein interaction
              (PPI) network, using the Random-Walk method as described in
              <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2427257/">Köhler</a>
              et al. (2008) to determine similarity within the PPI network on the basis
              of the global characteristics of the network.
